## Description

Introducing Informed Voter, the revolutionary website that empowers voters with intelligent and informed decision-making. With Informed Voter, you can say goodbye to the confusion and time-consuming research that comes with election season. Our platform analyzes the positions, track records, and policies of candidates. Seamlessly navigate through profiles, compare stances, and gain insights into their voting history. With Inforemd Voter, take charge of your vote and join the movement towards an informed electorate. Together, let's shape the future with Informed Voter.

## Motivation
We recognize the importance of an informed electorate and the impact it can have on shaping our society. By providing a comprehensive platform that analyzes candidate positions, track records, and policies, we aim to simplify the complex task of researching and understanding political candidates.

## How to Use 
Once the code has properly loaded, navigate to the intergrated terminal in the root directory and run the command `npm i` to install the application dependencies. After that, run the command `npm run develop` to deploy a development server. To acces the apollo server, simply navigate to `localhost:3001/graphql`; this allows access to the database queries.
